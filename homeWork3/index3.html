            The History of the Silmarils
        </h1>

        <p>
            It is told among the wise that the First War began before Arda was full-shaped, and ere yet there was any
            thing that grew or walked upon earth; and for long Melkor had the upper hand. But in the midst of the war a
            spirit of great strength and hardihood came to the aid of the Valar, hearing in the far heaven that there
            was battle in the Little Kingdom; and Arda was filled with the sound of his laughter. So came Tulkas the
            Strong, whose anger passes like a mighty wind, scattering cloud and darkness before it; and Melkor fled
            before his wrath and his laughter, and forsook Arda, and there was peace for a long age.

            In that time the Valar brought order to the seas and the lands and the mountains, and Yavanna planted at
            last the seeds that she had long devised. And since, when the fires were subdued or buried beneath the
            primeval hills, there was need of light, Aulë at the prayer of Yavanna wrought two mighty lamps for the
            lighting of the Middle-earth which he had built amid the encircling seas. Then Varda filled the lamps and
            Manwë hallowed them, and the Valar set them upon high pillars, more lofty far than are any mountains of the
            later days. One lamp they raised near to the north of Middle-earth, and it was named Illuin; and the other
            was raised in the south, and it was named Ormal; and the light of the Lamps of the Valar flowed out over the
            Earth, so that all was lit as it were in a changeless day.
        </p>
        <h2>
            Of Aulë and Yavanna
        </h2>
        <p>
            For it is said that after the departure of the Valar there was silence, and for an age Ilúvatar sat alone in
            thought. Then he spoke and said: 'Behold I love the Earth, which shall be a mansion for the Quendi and the
            Atani! But the Quendi shall be the fairest of all earthly creatures, and they shall have and shall conceive
            and bring forth more beauty than all my Children; and they shall have the greater bliss in this world. But
            to the Atani I will give a new gift.' Therefore he willed that the hearts of Men should seek beyond the
            world and should find no rest therein; but they should have a virtue to shape their life, amid the powers
            and chances of the world, beyond the Music of the Ainur, which is as fate to all things else; and of their
            operation everything should be, in form and deed, completed, and the world fulfilled unto the last and
            smallest.

            But Ilúvatar knew that Men, being set amid the turmoils of the powers of the world, would stray often, and
            would not use their gifts in harmony; and he said: ''These too in their time shall find that all that they
            do redounds at the end only to the glory of my work.' Yet the Elves believe that Men are often a grief to
            Manwë, who knows most of the mind of Ilúvatar; for it seems to the Elves that Men resemble Melkor most of
            all the Ainur, although he has ever feared and hated them, even those that served him.
